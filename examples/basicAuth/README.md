# Hadrian - Basic Authentication Example
> Fast and versatile authentication middleware for ExpressJs.

Cml

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/JazzBrown1/hadrian.git

$ cd hadrian/examples/basicAuth

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Send some GET requests to http://localhost:3040/get-some-info and http://localhost:3040/get-other-info. Postman is a good tool for this!

```sh
username: user,
password: password
```

Hack away!
